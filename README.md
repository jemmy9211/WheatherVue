# WeatherVue

## Introduction

WeatherVue is a web application that integrates with the public API provided by the Central Weather Bureau of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Utilizing the data offered by this API, the application employs advanced visualization techniques to enhance the accessibility of complex weather data for users. The project leverages Vue, Bootstrap, and Leaflet technologies, facilitating the rapid and practical development of the web interface. The following highlights the key features of the website:

- Real-time information from weather observation stations across Taiwan (including temperature, wind speed, forecasts, etc.).
- Location positioning of observation stations.
- Interactive map displaying weather observation stations throughout Taiwan (clicking on map markers provides details about the respective observation station).
- Search functionality enabling users to obtain data related to observation stations by station name or location.
- Radar echo map.

Please note that the Central Weather Bureau recently upgraded to the Meteorological Agency, necessitating the upcoming update of the authorization code. Last updated on 2023/10/11 by Jemmy at Selab.
